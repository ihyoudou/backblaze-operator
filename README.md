# Backblaze Operator
Simple Backblaze B2 Operator for Kubernetes

## Description
This project started as a test bed for me to learn operator-sdk. As of right now, it supports  
- [x] Creating and deleting B2 bucket  
- [x] Set and update bucket ACL  
- [x] Setting lifecycle policy on bucket  
- [x] Creating and writing application keys to secret  


## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster

**Using Helm** 

You can add repository using command
```
helm repo add isseispace https://ihyoudou.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
```
To install a release named `b2operator` run:
```
helm install b2operator isseispace/backblaze-operator \
--set credentials.b2ApplicationId="your-application-id" \
--set credentials.b2ApplicationKey="your-application-key" \
--set credentials.b2Region="us-west-004" \
--namespace b2operator --create-namespace
```
**Using manifests**

0. Clone this repository  

1. Create Master Application Key in Backblaze dashboard, base64 encode these credentials and put them in `config/manager/secret.yaml`
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: credentials
type: Opaque
data:
  B2_REGION: dXMtd2VzdC0wMDQ=  # us-west-004
  B2_APPLICATION_ID: ZXhhbXBsZQ==
  B2_APPLICATION_KEY: ZXhhbXBsZQ==

```
2. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kustomize build config/default | kubectl apply -f -
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
kustomize build config/default | kubectl delete -f -
```

### Example CRD Usage

```yaml
apiVersion: b2.issei.space/v1alpha1
kind: Bucket
metadata:
  name: my-b2-bucket
spec:
  acl: public
  bucketLifecycle:
    - fileNamePrefix: "/"
      daysFromUploadingToHiding: 2
      daysFromHidingToDeleting: 3
    - fileNamePrefix: "logs"
      daysFromUploadingToHiding: 5
      daysFromHidingToDeleting: 7
  writeConnectionSecretToRef:
    name: my-bucket-credentials
    namespace: default
```

## Contributing
Any contribution, tips and tricks are highly apperated

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
